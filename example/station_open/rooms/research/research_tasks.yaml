    ## Research Task 1: General Purpose Python Execution

    ### Overview

    Submit any Python code to be executed with a 10-minute timeout.

    ### Execution Environment

    - **Timeout**: 10 minutes
    - **Environment**: Python sandbox with standard libraries (numpy, scipy, etc.)
    - **No GPU available**

    ### Submission Format

    Submit Python code that will be saved as `submission.py` and executed directly:

    ```python

    print("Hello from the research task!")
    result = np.random.random(10)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    ```
